Final project for Brainstation's Data Science certification.

Jupyter notebook showing the process the for calculating and visualizing The Economist's "Raw Big Mac Index" and "Adjusted Big Mac Index".
Data was sourced from The Economist's repository, and the formulas were derived from The Economist's original code, which was written in R.

The code needs some cleaning to improve performance and readability, and further analysis and improvements should be done in the future.
